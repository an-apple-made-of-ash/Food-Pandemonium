<h1>Food Pandemonium</h1>
<h3>Hold on to your pizza slices, because Food Pandamonium is serving up a delivery experience that's more chaotic than a pineapple on a pizza!</h3>
Understanding the troubles that our delivery drivers undergo when delivering our products, we made a game that <i>slightly</i> exaggerates, just slightly, the major 4 challenges that they experience in their lives. 
<br><br>The game brings you, as the character, through 4 different rooms with various challenges to solve. The challenges were designed to be annoying and difficult.
<br><h3>To run the game: </h3>
We have yet to have implemented a complete script so for now you will have to manually run each room if you would like to try the game.
<ul>
  <li>Room 1: bordertest.py</li>
  <li>Room 2: room2withwind.py</li>
  <li>Room 3: room3updated.py</li>
  <li>Room 4: currently unuseable</li>
</ul>
Steps to run the room codes:
<ol>
  <li>Clone our Github repository onto your local device using Github desktop.</li>
  <li>Open the repository folder using your code editor. (We use VSCode)</li>
  <li>In rooms 2 and 3, fill in your own api keys.</li>
  <li>Run the respective codes for each room and have fun!</li>
</ol>
